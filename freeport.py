"""Pick a free TCP port, preferring a given one.

Dash aborts if its port is taken, which happens whenever another local
dashboard is already running on 8050. app.py calls find_free_port() on startup
rather than hard-coding the port.

    python freeport.py        # prints 8050, or the next free port
    python freeport.py 8600   # start looking at 8600 instead

The chosen port goes to stdout (so a script can capture it); anything human-
facing goes to stderr. Stdlib only, so this runs before any deps are installed.

    Two checks, because neither alone is enough on Windows:

    1. Connect. Dash's server (Flask/Werkzeug) binds with SO_REUSEADDR, which on
       Windows lets a second process bind the very same port -- so bind() alone
       happily reports a port that already has a dashboard on it as free, and
       you end up with two servers on one port. SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE does not
       help here: it only protects a port when the *first* binder sets it. A
       successful connection is direct proof that something is listening.
    2. Bind. Catches ports that are reserved or bound but not yet listening,
       which a connect probe cannot see.
